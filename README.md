This project focuses on image classification using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) on the CIFAR-10 dataset,
which contains 60,000 color images across 10 object categories. The model was built using Keras and TensorFlow, 
incorporating convolutional, pooling, and dense layers for feature extraction and classification. 
Data preprocessing, normalization, and regularization techniques were applied to improve accuracy. 
The trained model effectively classified images with high accuracy, demonstrating the strength of CNNs in computer vision tasks.
